## Synopsis

Argin is an open source project based on the Arduino platform.

The Argin is an automotive gear indicator having manual transmission H-type five-speed. Although you can use in vehicles with 6, 7 or more, speed (requires installation of more components and change the source code).

## Features

Basic functions:
— View the march used in the vehicle;
— Display brightness control;
— Source code available for improvements and / or changes.

## Motivation

Because this project exist?

As automotive enthusiast, identified the need for a gear indicator for my car. When searching only found for purchase models for vehicles with automatic transmission.
From this obstacle I started developing my own gear indicator and, after brief research and drafts, I opted for the ease of the Arduino platform.
